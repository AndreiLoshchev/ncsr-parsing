1) Annotated files

The annotated files (*-annotated.htm) do contain a distinct HTML comment right at the beginning of the table for 'statement of operations' (or multiple such markers if several tables are contained).
The marker is 

	<!--MARK_SOO_START-->


2) Remarks for specific documents

Document #4: numbers in SoO table are divided in two groups (tax exempt income, tax exempt opportunities)
Documents #4,5: contain several statement of operations table

Tables may be named both singular and plural ('Statement of operations' vs 'Statements of operations')
